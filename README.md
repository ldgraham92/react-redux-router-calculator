# React-Redux Assignment - Calculator

## Introduction
- This assignment is meant to challenge your knowledge of state, prop and element rendering in React while also using a store in redux to store information. React is currently one of the most popular and sought after front end technology at the moment, and having skills with it will greatly increase your employability. Redux is often used as a companion to React, and is favoured for storing (global) information over using local component state. 

## Requirements
### From "React Practice-Calculator with Prop"
- Use “npx create-react-app” to start a new React project.
- Create a “Calculator” component.
- Use a prop to output a unique heading for the component.
- Include two input fields that can take in numeric values, in your component return.
- Create a select (drop down box) which allows the user to choose what operation to apply to the two numeric fields, in your component return.
    - Your operations must include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### From "React Assignment - Calculator"
- Use state to keep track of the entered input values and current select value.
- Output to the user the result of the calculation onSubmit or onClick.

### From "React-Redux Assignment - Calculator"
- Store and output a list of prior calculations the user has done in and from React-Redux store.

### New for "React-Redux-Router Practice - Calculator"
- Use React Router to have a page for the calculator and a page for prior calculations (via Routes.)

## Challenges
- Make it look nice with some CSS!
- Protect data input - return a message to the user if the user inputs a non-numeric character / request.
- Have a single input field which can read the operations.
- Have the output list display in a different component than the Calculator component, illustrating one of the strengths of Redux as a global state management tool.
- Add a “light / dark mode” feature that is kept track of using a Redux store.

    - Make it look nice with some CSS!
    - Add a real “home” page with some information about your assignment.
